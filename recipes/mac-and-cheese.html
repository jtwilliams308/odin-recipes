    <p></p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>24 ounces extra-sharp yellow Cheddar cheese, cubed</li>
        <li>16 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, cubed</li>
        <li>2 pounds elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 pounds shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup seasoned breadcrumbs (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a large casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add milk, 
            bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. Mix flour with 2 to 3 
            tablespoons water until smooth.  Add flour mixture to the saucepan, 
            stirring constantly, and cook until sauce thickens. Add cubed 
            extra-sharp Cheddar and cubed sharp Cheddar cheese, stirring until 
            cheese melts. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook 
            elbow macaroni until al dente (tender with a bite), about 8 minutes, 
            or according to package instructions. Drain and set aside. </li>
        <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl on 
            High, about 10 seconds. In a large bowl, combine elbow macaroni, 
            melted  butter, and eggs. Stir in cheese sauce; adding a little 
            more milk if the sauce seems too thick. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour macaroni and cheese into the prepared casserole dish. Top 
            with shredded cheese and seasoned breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden-brown and bubbling, 35 
            to 45 minutes.</li>

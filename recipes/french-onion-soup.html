    <h2>Lazy French Onion Soup</h2>
    <p>For this lazy French onion soup, onions caramelize in the oven, with only 
        intermittent stirring. Toasted baguette and bubbly broiled Gruyère 
        cheese finish the soup.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 yellow onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 thyme sprigs, plus leaves for garnish</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry sherry</li>
        <li>6 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 fresh or dried bay leaf</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>12 (1/2-inch-thick) slices French bread loaf or other soft baguette, 
            lightly toasted</li>
        <li>8 ounces Gruyère cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees 
            F (220 degrees C) with rack in middle position.</li>
        <li>Combine onions, oil, and thyme sprigs in a heavy-bottomed pot or 
            large Dutch oven.</li>
        <li>Bake, covered, in the preheated oven, stirring once halfway through, 
            until onions are wilted and lightly browned, about 40 minutes. Uncover 
            and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until onions are golden 
            brown and caramelized, about 30 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and stir in sherry. Cook over medium, stirring constantly, 
            scraping up any browned bits from bottom and sides of pot, until liquid 
            has mostly evaporated, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in broth, Worcestershire, pepper, salt, and bay leaf; bring to a 
            boil over high. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, undisturbed, 
            allowing flavors to meld together, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat 
            and stir in cider vinegar. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Increase oven temperature to broil. Ladle soup evenly into 6 broiler-proof 
            bowls or crocks, and place bowls on a large rimmed baking sheet. Top 
            each bowl with 2 bread slices and about 1/3 cup Gruyère.</li>
        <li>Broil until Gruyère is bubbly and bread is browned in places, 3 to 5 
            minutes. Garnish with thyme leaves and serve immediately.</li>

    <h2>Scratch Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch 
        tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna 
        filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of 
        small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. 
        Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the meat:</strong> Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned 
            and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in 
            the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of 
            salt, oregano, and sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the noodles: </strong>Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted 
            water until they're al dente.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the cheese layer: </strong>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, 
            eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna: </strong>Layer the ingredients according to the 
            recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is 
            assembled.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the lasagna: </strong>Cover with foil and bake in the preheated 
            oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top 
            is golden brown.Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an 
            hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown. In an 
            oven preheated to 375 degrees F, this homemade lasagna should be perfectly baked 
            in about 50 minutes (30-40 minutes covered, 5-10 minutes uncovered).</li>

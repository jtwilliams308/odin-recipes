    <h2>Scratch Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch 
        tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna 
        filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of 
        small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. 
        Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 lb ground pork</li>
        <li>1/2 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>One can (8 oz) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>One can (28) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Two TBSP fresh chopped parsley, divided</li>
        <li>One clove crushed garlic</li>
        <li>1/8 TSP sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 TSP dried basil</li>
        <li>1/2 TSP dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 1/2 TSP salt</li>
        <li>1/4 TSP black pepper</li>
        <li>1 package (16 oz) uncooked lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 lb small curd cottage cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Shredded mozzarella</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 TSP salt</li>
        <li>1 package (16 oz) shredded mozzarella</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; 
            cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, 
            basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring 
            occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a 
            boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until 
            tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. While the 
            noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh 
            parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch 
            baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to 
            cover.</li>
        <li>Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of 
            the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, 
            cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum 
            foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake 
            until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and 
            serving.</li>

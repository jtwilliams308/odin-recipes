    <h2>Scratch Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch 
        tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna 
        filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of 
        small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. 
        Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
